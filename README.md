# command-line

## Description  


In my first project, I created a repository and made file modifications exclusively using the Command Line. GitBash has proven to be a fantastic tool that I learned about on my initial day as a Coding Bootcamp student. It has provided me with essential capabilities, enabling me to troubleshoot issues efficiently, thanks to commands like 'git status.' It simplifies the process of managing files and adding them to the repository. When I need to work on the code, I can simply type 'code .' to open VS Code, allowing me to make my edits comfortably.
